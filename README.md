This is a queueing system used by patients in a hospital. Python is used to develop this system and the visualization is done using Tkinter. It includes operations such as Enqueue, Dequeue, Update Priority, isEmpty and Queue Length.
Enqueue adds a person onto the queue. Dequeue removes a person from the queue. Update Priority updates the age of the patient already in the queue. isEmpty checks whether the queue is empty(returns True if the queue is empty, False otherwise). 
Queue Length returns the length of the queue.
